# Vegetables-Disease-Prediction-Deep-Learning (Vegi)

## Problem Statement:

The goal of this project is to create a website that allows users to upload photographs of vegetable leaves and properly detect if the leaves are healthy or diseased, as well as identify the disease if the leaves are unhealthy.

## Objective of the work:

The objective is to provide a user-friendly platform for farmers, gardeners, and enthusiasts to quickly identify and diagnose potential diseases affecting their crops. 

The website will analyze the uploaded images and provide real-time feedback, allowing users to take prompt action to mitigate crop damage and maximize yields. 

The project seeks to address the need for an efficient and accessible tool for leaf disease detection, aiding in early intervention and enhancing agricultural productivity.



## Setup for Python:

1. Install Python ([Setup instructions](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide))

2. Install Python packages

```
pip3 install -r training/requirements.txt
pip3 install -r api/requirements.txt
```

3. Install Tensorflow Serving ([Setup instructions](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/serving/setup))

## Setup for ReactJS

1. Install Nodejs ([Setup instructions](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/))
2. Install NPM ([Setup instructions](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm))
3. Install dependencies

```bash
cd frontend
npm install --from-lock-json
npm audit fix
```

4. Copy `.env.example` as `.env`.

5. Change API url in `.env`.



## Training the Model

1. Download the data from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/arjuntejaswi/plant-village).
2. Only keep folders related to Potatoes.
3. Run Jupyter Notebook in Browser.

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

4. Open `training/potato-disease-training.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
5. In cell #2, update the path to dataset.
6. Run all the Cells one by one.
7. Copy the model generated and save it with the version number in the `models` folder.

## Running the API

### Using FastAPI

1. Get inside `api` folder

```bash
cd api
```

2. Run the FastAPI Server using uvicorn

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0
```

3. Your API is now running at `0.0.0.0:8000`


## Running the Frontend

1. Get inside `api` folder

```bash
cd frontend
```

2. Copy the `.env.example` as `.env` and update `REACT_APP_API_URL` to API URL if needed.
3. Run the frontend

```bash
npm run start
```


8. Your model is now deployed.
